## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
. Why Python programming is awesome
. How to open a file
. How to write text in a file
. How to read the full content of a file
. How to read a file line by line
. How to move the cursor in a file
. How to make sure a file is closed after using it
. What is and how to use the with statement
. What is JSON
. What is serialization
. What is deserialization
. How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
. How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure
. How to access command line parameters in a Python script

## Requirements

Python Scripts

. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
. All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
. All your files should end with a new line
. The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
. Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
. All your files must be executable
. The length of your files will be tested using wc

Python Test Cases

. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
. All your files should end with a new line
. All your test files should be inside a folder tests
. All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
. All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
. All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
. All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
. All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
. A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
. We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
